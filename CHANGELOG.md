# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here, most recent first.

## 0.22.0

### Added
- `ContentSummary.concept` and `EntryData.concept`: the read model carries its resolved concept id, so a
  list or page branches per concept without re-deriving it from `entry.date`.
- A `summaryFields` knob on a concept config surfaces named frontmatter keys on `ContentSummary.fields`,
  so a list card reads an authored field with no per-entry detail read.
- The package root re-exports the delivery route loaders (`createPublicRoutes`) and the response helpers
  (`rssResponse`, `jsonFeedResponse`, `sitemapResponse`, `robotsResponse`).

### Changed (breaking)
- `CairnHead` moved off the `@glw907/cairn-cms/delivery` barrel to its own `@glw907/cairn-cms/delivery/head`
  entry, so a node-environment data import from `/delivery` stays component-free. Update the import:
  `import { CairnHead } from '@glw907/cairn-cms/delivery/head'`.
