# Roadmap

cairn-cms runs two production sites today, [ecxc.ski](https://ecxc.ski) (formerly ecnordic.ski) and
[907.life](https://907.life). It is `0.x` and breaks between minor versions; the latest published
release is `0.78.0`. The author is still working through the core-feature roadmap, and the project stays
closely held until that core lands.

This roadmap is a direction, not a commitment. Priorities shift as the production sites surface needs,
and items move up from lower tiers as the core fills in.

**This file is a pass dimension.** A pass that ships a roadmap item marks it done and removes it from the
live tiers, and a pass that surfaces a new direction files it into the right tier, the same way a pass
updates its reference docs. Shipped history lives in `docs/STATUS.md` and the per-plan post-mortems, not
here, so this file stays a forward view.

## Toward 1.0

cairn is `0.x` on purpose: it still breaks public seams between minors while the core lands, and SemVer
reserves `0.x` for exactly that. `1.0` is not a maturity badge; it is the commitment that breaking a public
seam becomes a major-version (`2.0`) event, which the charter already calls "a deliberate major-version
event, not an everyday one." Cut it when the surface stops moving, not on a date. Readiness checklist:

- [ ] **The public seams have held across an initiative or two with no breaking change**: the adapter and
  field schema, `render`, the admin mount (`createCairnAdmin`, the `CairnAdminShell` custom-route seam, the
  data-only `adminNav`), the route factories (`createContentRoutes`, `createPublicRoutes`), the admin design
  vocabulary (the `text-muted` / `text-subtle` role layer), and the log event names.
- [ ] **No known breaking change is pending** on the public surface, or each is consciously deferred to the
  first post-1.0 major. The SvelteKit `checkOrigin` removal (kit#15992) is the standing example: decide
  whether its fallback lands before 1.0 or becomes the first 2.0 driver.
- [ ] **Both production sites run the latest published cairn on the v2 adapter**, with their URL policies
  transcribed onto `defineConcept` (the per-site cutover watch items), so the real surface is exercised and
  needs no engine break to serve them.
- [ ] **The enforced boundary is green and complete**: `check:surface`, `check:reference`,
  `check:reference:signatures`, and `check:package` pass, and the surface they enumerate is the whole
  intended public API with nothing accidental.
- [ ] **The reference docs cover every export**, the guides and the upgrade guide are current, and the
  extending-developer seams (the thin seams plus the admin design vocabulary) are documented as the versioned
  contract a developer builds on.
- [ ] **The admin reads as an idiomatic exemplar**: the admin idiomatic re-expression sweep is done, so the
  surface a developer copies is native, not bespoke.
- [ ] **`create-cairn-site` ships**, so a new consumer starts from a scaffold rather than hand-copying the
  showcase. (Weigh whether this gates 1.0 or rides the first 1.x.)
- [ ] **The core-feature roadmap has landed** to the point the author opens the project up: the intro's
  "closely held until the core lands" condition is the same condition as 1.0.

When these hold, cut `1.0` deliberately, retire the `0.x` "minor = new subsystem / patch = everything else"
scale heuristic, and switch the numbers to their compatibility meaning (patch = fix, minor = additive,
major = breaking). The scheme and cadence live in `CLAUDE.md` ("Releases") and the
`cairn-release-process-and-versioning` memory.

## Now

- **Cross both production sites onto `0.78.0`.** The developer-extensibility seam and the editor tag
  vocabulary shipped in `0.78.0` (which rolled the held `0.77.0`). The remaining work is the site cutovers:
  mount the shared `/admin/+layout` on ecxc-ski and 907-life, read the shell from `page.data.shell`, and run
  the deferred live admin smoke against a real Worker. Tied to each site's v2-adapter cutover.
- **The starter-template track, then the docs phase** (the admin re-expression sweep is done). The admin
  sweep (Phases 0–6) re-expressed every admin component in native DaisyUI 5.6 / Tailwind 4: the
  `check:custom-surface` gate and the frozen `text-muted` / `text-subtle` role vocabulary (Phase 0) plus the
  vocabulary-screen pilot (Phase 1) shipped in `0.78.0`, and Phases 2–6 retired the admin's bespoke
  muted/subtle surface to its terminal floor (`retiredTokenBudget` 0), published as `0.78.1`. What remains:
  the starter-template track (re-express the showcase template in the same native idiom, now that the admin
  primitives have published into the showcase `file:` dep), then the docs phase (publish the role vocabulary
  as the versioned seam in `admin-design-system.md`). Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-admin-idiomatic-re-expression-design.md`.
- **CodeMirror integration: the suggestion popover.** Convert the spellcheck and objective-error
  suggestion popover from a skinned `@codemirror/lint` tooltip into cairn's own recipe DOM rendered
  through CodeMirror's public API (`showTooltip` facet + a caret `StateField` + `forEachDiagnostic`;
  `tooltipFilter` suppresses the built-in tooltip while `linter()` keeps the underline), and give it the
  keyboard and screen-reader path it has never had. A four-way adversarial review narrowed the original
  three-surface sweep to this one surface; the cut work is filed below (find/replace, autocomplete,
  editor a11y). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-cairn-cm-integration-design.md`; memory:
  `cairn-codemirror-integration-pass`.

## Next

- **Wire the Media Library's direct upload.** The Library screen's two `Upload` buttons (header and
  empty state) are unwired shells, but the `?/mediaUpload` action they need already exists and the
  replace flow uses it. Connect the buttons (and the empty-state drop target) to `?/mediaUpload` so an
  author can add an image from the Library, not only by inserting one while editing. A small media
  finish-up; surfaced by the 2026-06-28 principle-adherence audit, which left it untouched because that
  pass was remove-only. Drop the stale `TODO(Task 7+)` once wired.
- **Body-link cross-branch delete protection.** Lift the body-link delete guard from its current main-only
  posture to the strict, fail-closed cross-branch reference index that the reference delete and rename gates
  now use, so deleting a body-linked target refuses across every open branch the same way a referenced
  target does. The reference pass left this asymmetry deliberate (locked decision 9); this closes it.
- **Nested references inside a container.** Lift the reference field into an `object` or `array(object)` leaf;
  phase 3a deferred containers to scalars and image only. Needs the frontmatter-edge extractor to descend into
  object leaves, the byte-preserving rename rewriter to address a nested YAML path (the corruption-prone part
  the references fan-out caught bugs in), and the cross-branch index plus rename and delete gates to cover the
  nested edges.
- **The `create-cairn-site` scaffolder.** Sequenced after Contract v2 phases 1-2 so it bakes the template
  against v2. The pre-B3 engine/DX slot lands first (remove the calendar route, the GitHub-App "appId is
  config, not secret" trap, the doctor that greens while the deploy fails, and the other first-hour DX
  warts a dogfood found), then Part B3 (defaults) and B4 (options plus first-run), then the Part C
  generator. Plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-2*-cairn-scaffolder-*`.

## Later

- **Editor accessibility hardening (beyond the suggestion popover).** The CM integration pass gives the
  spellcheck and objective-error popover a keyboard and screen-reader path, but the editor's other
  accessibility gaps remain, surfaced by that pass's a11y review: the lint underline is a bare
  `text-decoration` with no `aria-invalid` or described-by relationship, there is no status live region
  for diagnostics, and the keymap wires no `lintKeymap`. A focused pass would give the whole editing
  surface a coherent accessibility model (diagnostic exposure, focus discipline, announcements) on the
  same public-API discipline the popover pass establishes, so it composes rather than re-litigates.
- **Test the `commitFiles` retry-loop 422 branch.** The fetch-level `GithubDouble` always fast-forwards,
  so the head-merge retry path (a concurrent commit moving the branch under an atomic commit, no
  `expectedHead`) is never exercised. Give the double a concurrency-injection hook and a fast-forward
  check so a test can drive the non-fast-forward retry. The fail-closed `expectedHead` path the backend
  seam added is tested; this is the older retry branch, a pre-existing gap surfaced by the seam's review.
- **Frontmatter field `description` channel.** Schema-authored per-field help rendered under the input,
  so the Details panel stops showing fields with no hint. Dovetails with the Contract v2 field work.
- **Nested-image delivery: seo and needs-alt.** Allow `seo: true` on an image inside a top-level `object`
  (phase 3a forbids it because `seo-fields.ts` reads a hardcoded key list, not the schema), and surface a
  nested image's missing alt in the editor's needs-alt advisory (3a's notice enumerates top-level images
  only). Both unlock when delivery seo resolution walks the concept schema, a fit for the 3b concept work.
- **Details panel default-open heaviness.** The Details slide-over defaults closed and buries every non-title
  field as the vocabulary grows; phase 3a's repeatable rows collapse per row, but the panel itself is
  unrevisited. Look at its default and grouping now that containers add fields.
- **`itemLabel` as a function (concept-array editor with a live-row snapshot).** Phase 3c shipped the cheap
  half of the data-versus-behavior split: the per-field `behavior.validate` runs server-side through the
  unified `fieldset` validator for concepts and component attributes alike. The function-valued `itemLabel`
  was cut (3c plan A14): it must run client-side in `RepeatableField` as the author types, but the rows are
  intentionally uncontrolled (`row.value` is stale between edits by design, to avoid edit loss), so feeding a
  live `itemLabel(item, index)` the row's current values needs a per-keystroke row-input snapshot plus a new
  client behavior channel (a `CairnAdmin` prop and scaffolder wiring). A focused concept-array-editor pass can
  design that live-row snapshot properly. The string `itemLabel` (a sub-field key) still covers the common case.
- **Merge the two form renderers.** Phase 3c unified the field vocabulary and the validation core, but
  `ComponentForm.svelte` and `FieldInput.svelte` still keep separate per-type switches and each wires the
  IconPicker itself (3c decision 9). Merging them onto one leaf-field renderer removes that duplication. The
  3a multi-instance focus risk is the hazard to design around, so it is a deliberate later refactor, not a
  drive-by.
- **Build-time icon-name validation against the set.** An icon value is a glyph name from the adapter's
  `rendering.icons`, but the `fieldset` validator only enforces required and non-empty (3c decision 1); it does
  not check the name against the set (the directive icon is not set-validated today either). A build-time check
  that a frontmatter or attribute icon name resolves in the declared set would catch a typo before delivery.
- **Empty-icon-set is a doctor-detectable config error.** A required `fields.icon()` field declared while the
  adapter ships no `rendering.icons` renders an unsavable picker with zero choices (3c A7). `cairn-doctor`
  could detect this configuration mismatch and report it rather than leaving the editor stuck at runtime.
- **Editor-help later slices.** The screen-contextual slide-over, a route- and concept-keyed help-content
  registry, and a standing Help home with a labeled launcher. The foundation shipped in `0.61.0`-`0.62.1`.
- **Per-field advisory seam plus live slug recompute.** An editor-side advisory-validation surface, and a
  slug preview that recomputes as the author retypes.
- **`supportContact` personalization.** A richer shape than the current bare string, a name plus a
  contact, so a self-serve hand-off reads personally.
- **Date-vs-publish field redesign.** A product look at the date field's label and affordance, since it
  reads as if it might schedule publishing.
- **Starter content and onboarding progress.** Concept-differentiated seed content for the strongest
  first-run activation, and a per-editor getting-started progress record.
- **Remaining media work.** Media Pass D and the Media Library direct upload, plus the owed live
  bulk-delete admin smoke. Passes 1-3c and A-C shipped across `0.57.0`-`0.59.0`.
- **Small DX debt.** Fix the flaky spellcheck `e2e` so it stops blocking releases (a settle-aware
  assertion, not a single `toHaveCount`), give the component picker dialog a `sm:`-breakpoint bottom-sheet
  so it is not an unconditional `85vh` on a short viewport, and resolve the worktree dual vite/kit install
  collision (the showcase typecheck throws ~12 dependency-`.d.ts` errors under a symlinked-`node_modules`
  worktree, so the local consumer-build proof currently leans on the e2e build; CI's real checkout is
  clean). The first two are in `docs/internal/docs-friction-log.md`.
- **Engine-provided `inFeeds`/`routable` feed and sitemap views.** Phase 3b makes `routing.inFeeds`,
  `routable`, and `dated` concept-declared but keeps `inFeeds` a consumer-read hint: no engine code filters
  on it, so a site's feed and sitemap routes still hand-pick their concepts. Lands in the render/delivery
  phase, where the delivery surface exposes a feed view (the `inFeeds` concepts) and a sitemap view (the
  `routable` concepts) so a consumer stops re-deriving membership.
- **Watch: transcribe the site URL policies into `defineConcept` at each v2 cutover.** When ecxc-ski and
  907-life cut over to the v2 adapter, move each site's YAML `content:` URL policy onto its concepts via
  `defineConcept` (ecxc-ski: posts `/:year/:month/:slug`, `datePrefix: month`; 907-life: posts
  `/:year/:month/:day/:slug`, `datePrefix: day`), delete the YAML `content:` block and the dead `url:` key,
  and verify the live permalinks. The phase 3b hard-error in `parseSiteConfig` makes a missed transcription
  fail loud rather than silently default `datePrefix` to `day` and shift every post URL. Tied to each site's
  v2 cutover pass.
- **Migrate cairn's CSRF-disable before SvelteKit removes `checkOrigin`.** cairn's admin CSRF ownership
  depends on `csrf: { checkOrigin: false }`, deprecated in SvelteKit 2.61. `trustedOrigins` cannot replace
  it: a missing-`Origin` POST is always forbidden, and the check runs before the `handle` hook. The
  planned fallback is an edge Transform Rule that injects `Origin` for `/admin` POSTs; the higher-leverage
  path is the upstream issue (sveltejs/kit#15992). Track the removal and act before a major lands.
  Reasoning in `docs/cairn-dx-feedback-2026-06-09-907-0.36-retrofit.md`.

## Considering

- **A third content concept (Fragments).** The fixed-concepts model leaves room for a Fragments concept
  beyond Posts and Pages, scoped when a production site needs it.
- **Editor find/replace.** A recipe-built find/replace panel on `@codemirror/search`'s `createPanel`,
  keeping CodeMirror's search state and commands but rendering cairn DOM. Bind only the search subset of
  `searchKeymap` (not the stock un-themed `gotoLine` panel or the multi-cursor bindings it also carries),
  and honor the full panel a11y contract (no focus trap, labeled stateful toggles with `aria-pressed`, a
  polite match-count live region reading "3 of 12"). Cut from the CM integration pass as new capability,
  not chrome alignment: cairn edits short Posts and Pages and the browser already finds visible text, so
  scope it only if find/replace is genuinely wanted, on its own merit.
- **Autocomplete dropdown look (conditional).** The link-completion dropdown stays a plain CodeMirror
  default. The CM integration pass deliberately did not align it: CodeMirror offers no public replacement
  for the dropdown container, so skinning it would add internal-class coupling (`.cm-completionLabel`,
  `.cm-completionMatchedText`) on a rarely-seen surface, against the pass's shrink-the-fragility goal.
  Revisit only if the default reads as jarring in practice, and only through the public
  `tooltipClass`/`optionClass` tint (font and surface on the container), never reaching into the internal
  completion classes; hold the selected state to a non-color cue and the contrast floors.
- **A strong/gentle CTA pair in the starter template (DaisyUI Aura).** The template could offer a
  developer two call-to-action treatments to choose from: a strong one using DaisyUI's Aura animated glow
  and a gentle one without. Template only. The admin interface stays restrained and never uses Aura.
