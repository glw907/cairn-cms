# cairn-cms status

Present tense only; past tense lives in [`docs/HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md), durable orientation in
`CLAUDE.md`. `cairn-pass` rewrites this at each pass-end.

## Current state

Published: **`0.97.0`** on npm `latest` (release commit `eefd51b4`, GitHub release `v0.97.0`),
with `@glw907/cairn-cms-dev` `0.97.0` beside it. It carries everything through the Go tool's B2,
the doctor retirement (retire-1, retire-2a `688aba41`, retire-2b `2fa772ba`), draft docs pass A,
and the pre-cut dependency top-up (PR #86, `2e497a1a`). The Go `cairn` tool ships separately as
`tool/v1.1.0`. `main` has no `## Unreleased` window yet. Held majors: `devalue` 6, TypeScript 7,
Vitest 5, `@types/node` 26. CI is green.

cairn.pub's own docs debt is [this handoff](internal/record/2026-09-22-cairn-pub-docs-handoff.md),
un-pinnable against the registry since `0.95.0` on `pass-d-docs-tracks`. Live contracts from the
pre-task: `tool/internal/{spine/conditions,doctor/site-config-path}.json` under
`check:tool-conditions`, and `.cairn/site-facts.json`, written by `cairn-manifest`, verified in the
plugin's `buildStart`.

## Immediate next action

The `0.97.0` cut is done (2026-09-23). The docs-reset session (PR #85, branch `docs-reset`)
merges next and writes the next action here. `ROADMAP.md` sequences what follows.

## Open decisions and watches

- Node 26 becomes the floor at beta only if it is Active LTS by then (Current until Oct 2026);
  TypeScript 7 stays held until `svelte-check --tsgo` runs green (`tsgo.yml` checks weekly).
- extend-1's two advisory audit rules go to error tier at `0.98.0`; `cairn-audit --rendered`
  counts differently on identical runs (133 then 116), stabilize before trusting either.
- Monthly routines: a Cloudflare capability review (`trig_01GnFPkfx7EjrWKAuTBrXVdx`) and a Claude
  Code guidance-schema check (`trig_01UyjoYo9hbGqm7qTeb7HGVH`), emailing only on a mismatch.
  `CAIRN_GH_READ_TOKEN` expires 2026-10-19; the daily `cairn-tripwire` catches it early.
- A consumer `guard.rejected` with `detail: 'mismatch'`, `witness: 'field'` can be the known
  double-mint residual; the discriminator names any genuinely new one. Three ASC staging harvest
  docs are folded into cairn, deletable once `email-announce` settles; the heavy gate runs the
  component project serially (`--no-file-parallelism`).
- `npm publish` (npm 11) warns that it removes the four `bin` entries because their paths carry
  a leading `./`; the entries still ship (verified in the `0.96.0` and `0.97.0` tarballs and
  registry metadata). Drop the `./` prefix (`npm pkg fix`) in the next window before a newer npm
  turns the warning into a real removal.

## Resume prompt

In a fresh session started with `claude --model claude-opus-5-5` (effort `medium`), read this
file and the latest `docs/HISTORY.md` entry, then take the next action above.
