# Create a Google Cloud project

A Google Cloud project is required to use Google Workspace APIs and build Google Workspace add-ons or apps. A Cloud project forms the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services, including managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.

## Create a Cloud project

### Google Cloud console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu menu \> **IAM & Admin** \> **Create a Project**.

    [Go to Create a Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

2.  In the **Project Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your project.

    Optional: To edit the **Project ID**, click **Edit**. The project ID can't be changed after the project is created, so choose an ID that meets your needs for the lifetime of the project.

3.  In the **Location** field, click **Browse** to display potential locations for your project. Then, click **Select**.
    **Caution: Can't find your Google Workspace organization?**\
    This means you aren't signed in to a Google Workspace account. Some of the features described in Google Workspace developer documentation are only available to projects associated with an organization.

4.  Click **Create**. The Google Cloud console navigates to the Dashboard page and your project is created within a few minutes.

### gcloud CLI

In one of the following development environments, access the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`):

**Cloud Shell**: To use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI already set up, activate Cloud Shell.\
[Activate Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

**Local Shell**: To use a local development environment, [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI.\
To create a Cloud project, use the `gcloud projects create` command:

```
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `PROJECT_ID` by setting the ID for the project you want to create.

For further information on Cloud projects, refer to [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) in the Google Cloud documentation.

## Optional: Enable billing for your Cloud project

Depending on the Google Workspace APIs and features that you want to use, you might also need to enable billing for your Cloud project:

If you're unable to link a billing account, you don't have the permissions needed to make this change. For more information, see [Permissions required to enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#required-permissions-enable).

### Google Cloud console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to **Billing**. Click **Menu** menu \> **Billing** \> **My Projects**.

    [Go to Billing for My Projects](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects)

2.  In **Select an organization**, choose the organization associated with your Google Cloud project.

3.  In the project row, open the **Actions** menu (more_vert), click **Change billing**, and choose the Cloud Billing account.

4.  Click **Set account**.

### gcloud CLI

1.  To list available billing accounts, run:

    ```
    gcloud billing accounts list
    ```

2.  Link a billing account with a Google Cloud project:

    ```
    gcloud billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
    ```

    Replace the following:

3.  `PROJECT_ID` is the **Project ID** for the Cloud project for which you want to enable billing.

4.  `BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID` is the **billing account ID** to link with the Google Cloud project.

For further information about billing, see [Enable, disable, or change billing for a project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) in the Google Cloud Billing documentation.
