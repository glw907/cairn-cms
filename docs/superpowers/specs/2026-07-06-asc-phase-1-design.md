# aksailingclub.org phase 1: the gentle redesign onto cairn

**The brainstorm and the UI/UX work session are complete; the design recipes are locked
from Geoff's picks. Awaiting his ratification read of this document, then writing-plans.**

Drafted during the 2026-07-06 brainstorm (Geoff + the main loop; the Fable-native format).
The highest bar of the ladder: a real member base. The full visual-fidelity method binds.

## What this is

The club's public site rebuilt on cairn (`@glw907/cairn-cms` >= 0.81.0, the chassis
structure), preserving what works — the palette, fonts, iconography, information
architecture, basic layout, and the gentle animations and mouseover behaviors (Geoff:
"decent — keep/improve those"; motion carries into the theme, refined not replaced) — while fixing the four named issues: complex CSS, busy
pages, uneven responsiveness, and heavy card use. Phase 2 (the functional member pages and
the admin/members migration on the extending-developer seam) and phase 3 (the handbook on
Topo) are scoped here only as boundaries.

## The governing goal: simplify IT

Reduce vendors and technologies (Geoff, 2026-07-06). The migration's arc takes the club
from roughly nine vendors and stacks (Hugo on a GCE origin, three email senders,
MembershipWorks, the abandoned experiment) toward four (Cloudflare, GitHub, Google
Workspace, Discord) on one tech stack. Phase 1's contributions: the GCE origin retires at
cutover; cairn replaces Hugo and the prior experiment; the sending-subdomain onboarding
begins the email consolidation. Every later decision gets the vendor-count test.

## Locked decisions

- **Fresh start; mine the prior work.** A new repo scaffolds from the chassis. The prior
  SvelteKit migration (`aksailingclub-sveltekit`: the dev shell, the D1 members database,
  the handbook work) is an evidence base for phase 2, not a foundation to build on.
- **Phase-1 content line: guides in, functional out.** Every static member guide migrates
  as cairn content; the directory, my-account, and anything data/auth-driven waits for
  phase 2 behind a small "coming soon" surface.
- **Concepts: posts, pages, notifications.** Posts carry news, results, and recaps with a
  curated tag vocabulary. Pages hold the stable content. Notifications are a site-declared
  concept (title, short body, expiry) rendering as the home banner.
- **Events are D1 data, not content.** The public calendar reads the club's D1 as a
  site-owned route beside cairn (the charter's build-outside mode). Event administration
  stays in the existing ops stack until phase 2. The schema is verified from the prior
  migration's `db/` at plan time.
- **Editors: Geoff as owner plus a short volunteer allowlist**, magic-link. The admin
  experience is their whole interface and gets polish attention.

## The design language: a content-density system

Cards are refined, not removed (Geoff: "cards aren't inherently a problem"):

- **Subtler:** lighter chrome — reduced border/shadow/radius stacking, no cards inside
  cards, quieter surfaces.
- **Selective:** cards where they earn their place — true objects (the news cards, which
  work well and stay essentially as-is; event rows; notifications) and deliberate rhythm
  breaks in long content.
- **The wall of text is the significant enemy.** This is a content-heavy site; long pages
  (education, guides, governance) get an explicit density strategy: section bands, asides
  and glosses, callouts, two-up groupings, and in-page TOCs on the longest pages — the
  component vocabulary the ecxc training page proves, tuned to ASC's voice.
- **THE WORK SESSION RAN AND ITS PICKS ARE LOCKED (2026-07-06):** the show-and-tell
  ratified the narrowed diagnosis; the calibration settled the recipes. **A1 (quieted,
  bands kept):** bands mark sections, cards mark objects, nothing gets both; the welcome
  unboxed ("Ahoy!" as the heading, the welcome line opening the lede beneath it); the
  notification as a slim accent strip; content directly on bands; one spacing scale
  (large fixed inter-section rhythm, half within sections, band padding deeper than the
  inter-section gap). **B1 (editorial pacing)** is the house density style for long
  content: an at-a-glance table up front, real subheads, tightened prose — no new chrome
  (B2's day-cards were considered and not chosen). These recipes generalize site-wide as
  the theme's house style; Geoff: B1 "a significant improvement over the original."
  **Home-page additions (Geoff, same session):** the Fleet and Facilities sections are
  two-column compositions with EMPTY image columns — phase 1 completes them with real club
  photography (a fleet shot; a grounds shot), curated into the media library with alt
  text. **DECISION C ITERATED TO THE FINAL PAIR (C7 recommended):** the Season consolidates into
  the quiet two-column band (C3's base: months on weight and air, no rules; groups never
  split; one column under 900px), with the mission-first taxonomy Geoff set (education
  most prominent — the club is an educational 501(c)(3); "emphasis encodes the mission"
  is now a standing design principle) marked by an ACCENT DOT before classes/clinics (C7):
  the dot spends no hue, event names stay ink and linkable, blue remains exclusively the
  link affordance, and the family's amber stays caution-only (the C8 second-color
  alternative is on file if ever needed). Content note: Fleet Tune-Up Weekend is a clinic
  (education); the D1 events schema wants a category field that reflects this taxonomy.
  Superseded along the way: C2's rules/racing-bold (too busy two-up; racing emphasis
  inverted the mission).**
  *(The earlier C2 lock is superseded by the above.)*
  ORIGINAL-C2-NOTE:  The
  Season consolidates from six month-boxes into a single band listing — month names in
  full ink with hairline rules as scan anchors, events at body size with quiet tabular
  dates, racing in the accent blue (the color scan answers "when do we race?"), two
  columns at desktop with month groups never splitting, one column under 900px. The
  direction is locked; the build's design stage refines the details in place.
- **The original work-session definition (ran as designed):** two sittings with Geoff. (1) THE SHOW-AND-TELL: curated exhibits from the
  scroll-primed captures — the news cards at their best, the chrome-stacking at its
  heaviest, the education page's full height, the responsive rough spots — so the
  diagnosis is agreed over evidence. (2) THE CALIBRATION: candidates across three page
  archetypes (home with refined cards; one long content page with the density toolkit at
  two or three intensities; one post), rendered as scrollable artifacts; Geoff's picks
  become the locked design recipes the build executes. The session's outputs ARE the
  theme's specification; everything after is implementation.

**The ratified diagnosis (the show-and-tell, Geoff 2026-07-06: "that all looks correct"):**
the site is mostly good — clean phone reflows, strong sections (the news grid is the card
treatment done right), concise governance. The busy-ness lives in exactly three places:
(1) the home page's chrome stack (three background/card layers in 900px); (2) per-SECTION
prose walls (education's day-by-day schedule; the new-member guide's top half), with the
fix already demonstrated by neighboring sections (tables, subheads, bullets); (3) the join
page's hand-off to the MembershipWorks embed, which is NOT stylable — a known constraint
that resolves when the ops absorption takes over membership functionality, not a design
task. The calibration candidates therefore target: home chrome-quieting, and the
section-density toolkit at two intensities on education's schedule.

Responsiveness meets the family five-viewport standard (320/390/768/1440/2560, composed at
the extremes). The CSS complexity collapses into the chassis token system and composition
primitives; the theme layer carries ASC's palette, faces, and iconography.

## The color story — "the club grounds" (RATIFIED with the full example, Geoff: "Excellent. That works.")

The current palette was Blowfish's defaults, never a choice; the ratified story builds
from the club's own materials, replacing the original "preserve the palette" keep by
Geoff's own correction. Roles are the contract; exact values tune during the build:

- **Flag navy** (~#1C4670, deep #12294A): links, structure, identity — the only link color.
- **Star gold** (~#E3A008): marks and waypoints only, never body text — the active-nav
  underline, the notification edge, and THE GOLD STARS MARKING CLASSES AND CLINICS in
  event lists (the flag marking the mission).
- **Fireweed** (~#B23A77): the single pop — primary CTAs, at most twice per page.
- **Building sage** (tints ~#F2F5F1/#E5EBE3): the band and surface neutrals — the grounds
  carried into the page.
- **Harbor ink** (~#16222E) and its muted step: text.
- The purple trim stays on the doors (declined, deliberately). The semantic palette
  (caution/success/error) remains a separate reserved vocabulary — the education category
  can never collide with warnings again.

**The north star:** the complete home example at
`docs/superpowers/specs/assets/2026-07-06-asc-home-northstar.html` — every locked decision
(A1's quieting, the C7-dot-evolved-to-gold-stars season, the fleet/facilities photo
compositions, the mission-first CTA, gentle hover motion) in the story, blessed whole.
The full calibration record (C0 through C9, the iteration's reasoning) sits beside it.

## Method, staging, cutover

- The device catalogue from the 146 live-site captures precedes any build (the
  visual-fidelity method end to end: reference-first, fresh-context verifier loops,
  the one-check rule, the pixel-diff CI rider, the chassis harvest — this is the chassis's
  seventh consumer and improves it per the standing doctrine).
- During development the cairn build serves at **dev.aksailingclub.org** (replacing the
  migration shell on that hostname), Access-protected as today, so volunteers preview
  behind the existing login. The service-token machinery for non-interactive verification
  already exists (the `asc-cloudflare-access` memory).
- **Cutover is a DNS change** (apex to the new worker; full Cloudflare access is in hand),
  gated on Geoff's explicit go per the member-facing rule, with the GCE origin retiring
  after a soak period.

## The coexistence strategy (Geoff, 2026-07-06: the early-cutover win)

Cutting the production site over to cairn EARLY, with the old ops stack still running
beside it, is the strategic shape: users and editors get the improved experience sooner,
and ops functionality then migrates BIT BY BIT rather than as one big phase-2 event.
Consequences the design carries:

- **Coexistence is a requirement, not a transition state.** The cairn site and the
  existing ops stack (ops.aksailingclub.org, its D1) run side by side for as long as the
  incremental migration takes; the events read integration must not disturb ops's
  ownership of that data.
- **Phase 2 becomes incremental ops absorption:** each ops capability (events admin, the
  directory, my-account, membership flows) moves in its own small pass onto the
  extending-developer seam, harvested and verified like every other pass in this program,
  with the old ops surface retiring piece by piece.
- The phase-1 cutover is therefore gated only on the PUBLIC site's quality, never on
  ops-migration readiness.

## Out of scope (phase boundaries)

- Phase 2+: the incremental ops absorption described above (the members directory,
  my-account, auth beyond magic-link editors, event administration), each piece its own
  pass; the reconciliation with the prior migration's D1 rides the first such pass.
- Phase 3: handbook.aksailingclub.org on Topo (after Topo exists).
- The Blowfish origin site's decommissioning rides the cutover's soak, not this spec.

## Acceptance (phase 1 is done when)

- Every public page and phase-1 guide serves from the cairn build with the permalink
  contract intact (the live sitemap is the reference; sanctioned redirects only).
- The design reads as the club's site (glance test by members' standards), with the four
  issues demonstrably addressed and the mockup-gate calibration applied.
- The five-viewport matrix passes; the pixel-diff rider is in the site's CI.
- Volunteers can sign in by magic link and edit posts, pages, and notifications; the
  events calendar renders from D1.
- Geoff's before/after approval precedes the cutover DNS change.
